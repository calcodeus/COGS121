The UI looks cleaner with all the pages having a 
uniform center-alignment. Some more specific 
changes are that in the favorites page, the listed
shows and movies have a delete button that allows
users to remove the entries they don't want to
keep, and in the recommendations page, the animes
are in a title-card layout instead of a list.

### User Action 1

In the recommendations page, users can now click
on an anime title and it will open up a
a description page, showing more details 
about that specific anime. It pulls 
information from TMDB to populate the
page with the proper information for the
anime that was clicked on.

### User Action 2

Users can enter their favorite movies
and shows into the search bar and interact
with the list. They can now delete 
entries that they don't want to keep
and the list will be saved even when 
they leave the page. This way, they can
edit their favorites and refine their 
anime recommendations.
