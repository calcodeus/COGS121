### Screenshots

These are the first two pages of our app. We changed the background
of the pages to be black and made it so that the explanation of the app 
on the front page is now consistent with the app's overall style. When 
you click next on the favorites page, it will take you to the data 
visualization portion of the app, which is where most of the UI
changes occurred.

### Data Visualization

These are the data visualization screenshots. They're all from the
same page, but different actions taken changes the content on the page.
The starting view are two groups of nodes that are connected by edges.
The nodes on the left are the favorite movies and shows submitted by
the user on the previous page and the ones on the right are the
resulting recommended animes. Anime nodes are connected to the
favorite shows and movies that are related to them.

You can move the group of nodes as a whole around the screen and zoom in as
seen here.

You can click on a specific anime node and the position of the nodes will adjust
so that the selected anime is zoomed into and the favorite shows and movies 
related to them will show up around it. It will also display a box on the left
that shows the poster and synopsis of that anime.

The same effect will occur when you click on one of the movies or shows that were
submitted. It will show more information about the movie or show and all of the
animes connected to it.

There is a button on the top right corner that you can click and it will
deselect the currently selected node and zoom the page out as seen by the 
screenshot below. You can also go back to the home page from here or 
back to the favorites page where you can edit your list of favorites 
and generate new recommendations.
