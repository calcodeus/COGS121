Project Proposal:
We propose creating a Bitcoin price tracker that displays news 
for each price point that perhaps explains why the price went up or down. 
Crypto is a very new, exciting, and popular market right now and connecting 
news with bitcoin value will help users make educated decisions on how to 
invest in the market. We plan to accomplish this goal by using CoinDesk API
for the price data, and Solume API for news and social media buzz. CoinDesk
has a real-time Bitcoin Price Index API free to use by the public. Solume
also has an accessible API that we can use.
