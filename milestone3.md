# Milestone 3

### Changes

We chose to follow our second prototype more 
because after we did a bit of research into 
possible ways of linking accounts, we found out
that APIs, for security reasons, don't tend to
provide data attached to users, even with 
login credentials. Our skeleton work is
pretty similar to our prototypes aside from 
the rough/bare styling. The first and last pages 
are the ones that contain functionality while
our second page is still just a basic skeleton.
