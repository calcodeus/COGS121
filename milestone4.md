### User Privacy
The data will be saved during the searching process of what 
movie or television shows the user choses as a template for 
what animes will be reccommended to them. Data that the user 
inputs will not be saved once the user is done finding what 
anime they would like to watch. All inputs would be anonymous 
so no user information would be gathered while using the 
application.
