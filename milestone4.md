# Milestone 4

### Changes

For this milestone, we've added a new page to our webapp.
We still have our homepage and favorites page but instead
of recommendations being on one page only, we added an additional
page. The first page for recommendations simply shows a list
of the recommended animes showing the poster and title. If you
click on one of those animes, it will now lead you to another
page that contains more information about that anime including
the synopsis, year it was released and IMDB rating. The UI for
this page was made cleaner with everything being centered and
laid out nicely.

### User Privacy
The data will be saved during the searching phase of what 
movie or television shows the user choses as a template for 
what animes will be reccommended to them. Data that the user 
inputs will not be saved once the user is done finding what 
anime they would like to watch. All inputs would be anonymous 
so no user information would be gathered while using the 
application.
